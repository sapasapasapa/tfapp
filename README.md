### Collapsible Plan View

When viewing Terraform plans, you can now easily toggle resource blocks and nested sections:
- Space/Left/Right to expand/collapse sections
- 'a' key to expand all sections at once
- 'A' key to collapse all sections at once
- 'j'/'k'/Up/Down to navigate through resources
- 'g' or Home key to jump to the top
- 'G' or End key to jump to the bottom
- '/' to enter search mode and search within the plan
- 'n' to find the next search match
